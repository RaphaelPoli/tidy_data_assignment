Id variables are 
subject (there are 30)
activity (there are 6)


Measurement variables: there are 86, only means and standard deviations.
I separated them in four groups according to the original code book. 
Those groups are not mentioned in the data set as it was not also in the original one.



All variables containing “mean”: Mean value for each measurement
“tbodyaccmeanx"
